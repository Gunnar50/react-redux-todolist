# Todo List

## 🌐 Project

This Todo List app is part of the [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW), designed to test and enhance front-end development skills. While this implementation does not completely adhere to all the challenge's requirements, it successfully functions as an intuitive and effective task management tool. Developed using React and Redux, it also utilizes local storage for persisting user data
